Click on `+ Integration` to introduce a new Docker Image Registry credential into your project.

When linking a Docker Image Registry resource, you are required to provide the following details:

> NOTE<br/>
> For the Registry URL, adhere to the format docker.io/username, where username is the username associated with your Docker account. Ensure `not` to append a `/` at the end of the URL.

Finally select `Create` button to save the credential.

## 02 - Edit Credential

Any Docker Image Registry credential you've added can be modified later through the image registries list page.
